<h2>CODE DISPLAY - Debounce function</h2>
<p>This code defines a debounce function in TypeScript, which helps limit the rate at which a
     function can be called. Itâ€™s typically used to optimize performance by preventing a function 
     from being triggered too frequently, such as when handling events like resizing or scrolling.</p>
<PRE>const debounce = (fn: Function, ms = 300) => {
let timeoutId: ReturnType;
return function (this: any, ...args: any[]) {
  clearTimeout(timeoutId);
timeoutId = setTimeout(() => fn.apply(this, args), ms);
};
};</PRE>
