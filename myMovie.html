    <h2>Komala Soleti</h2>
    <p>I like movie named Lucky Bhasker because it shows the true emotions and problems of middle class people,
     it also shows how we can earn without commiting crimes but with the little cheat code and also have shown
     how one gets perks with consequences. It truly inspiered me.</p>

     <h1>Suggested Actors for the Main Role</h1>

    <p>In this table, I have listed some actors who I think could also play the main role in [BHGAVATHAM].
     While the original actor did an excellent job, these alternative choices could bring fresh 
     perspectives to the character. Some actors are known for their dramatic performances, 
     while others have unique qualities that could bring an exciting twist to the role.</p>
